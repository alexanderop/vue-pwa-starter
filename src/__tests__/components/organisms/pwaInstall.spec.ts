 * The install hint, driven the way the browser drives it: a
 * `beforeinstallprompt` event arrives (or does not), and everything else
 * follows from that. See helpers/installEvent.ts for why the event is stubbed.
 *
 * Chromium in a headless test run never fires the real event and never
 * matches `display-mode: standalone`, so "not installed, no prompt offered"
 * is the ambient state of every test here — which is exactly the case the
 * first one pins.
