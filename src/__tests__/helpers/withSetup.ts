 * A composable called bare from a spec still *returns* the right values, which
 * is why the gap is easy to miss. What it does not do is ever stop:
 * `useEventListener`, `useIntervalFn` and `watchEffect` all register their
 * teardown with `onScopeDispose`, and with no active scope that registration
 * is a silent no-op. The listener stays on `window`, the interval keeps
 * firing, and the spec passes. See docs/testing-composables.md for which
 * composables in this app need this and which genuinely do not.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const { result: age } = mountComposable(() => useNoteAge(() => updatedAt))
 * ```
 *
 * Prefer the `mountComposable` fixture in `../fixtures.ts`, which registers
 * the unmount for you. Reach for this directly only outside a test body.
