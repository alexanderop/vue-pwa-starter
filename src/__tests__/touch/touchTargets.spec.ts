/**
 * The 44px floor, asserted where it is actually observable.
 *
 * Sizing in this app is written touch-first and collapsed for a fine pointer
 * (`h-touch-target … pointer-fine:h-10`, see src/components/atoms/AtomButton.vue),
 * so on every other browser tier the collapsed value is what renders — a
 * desktop Chromium matches `pointer: fine`. That makes this the one tier that
 * measures what a phone gets, and the reason it exists as its own project
 * rather than as a spec somewhere: the condition comes from the browser
 * context, and `matchMedia` cannot be stubbed from inside the page.
 *
 * The a11y tier does not cover this and cannot: axe's `target-size` rule uses
 * the WCAG 2.2 AA floor of 24×24. A 40px button satisfies axe and fails us.
