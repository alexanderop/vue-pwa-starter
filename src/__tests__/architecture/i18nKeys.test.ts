/**
 * Keeps the message catalogue and the code that reads it in step.
 *
 * Parity between locales is already the type system's job — `de.ts` is
 * annotated `MessageSchema`, so a missing or misspelt German key is a compile
 * error and needs no test. What types cannot see is the other two ways a
 * catalogue rots:
 *
 * 1. **Keys nothing uses.** Deleting a control leaves its strings behind, and
 *    every translator pays for them forever. Nothing fails, so nobody notices.
 * 2. **Keys built at runtime.** `t(`notes.age.${unit}`)` compiles whatever
 *    `unit` is, so the typed-key guarantee that makes `t('nav.typo')` a
 *    compile error stops applying exactly where it is easiest to get wrong.
 *
 * Interpolation is not banned — it is the honest way to say "one of these
 * four" — but it has to be declared, and the declaration is checked against
 * the catalogue in both directions.
