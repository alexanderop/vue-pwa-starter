/**
 * The browser tiers' `it`, with the screen objects handed over as fixtures —
 * the counterpart of `test/e2e/fixtures.ts`, so a spec and a Gherkin step
 * declare the screen they drive rather than constructing one:
 *
 * ```ts
 * it('creates a note', async ({ notes }) => { … })
 * ```
 *
 * A fixture owns the whole lifecycle — reset the app state, mount, unmount
 * when the test ends — which is what removes the `let screen: … | undefined`
 * plus `beforeEach`/`afterEach` pair every browser spec used to carry. It is
 * also lazy: a test that never names `notes` never mounts it, so a spec file
 * can mix screens without paying for the ones it does not use.
 *
 * Written with the builder syntax (`.extend(name, fn)`, Vitest 4.1) rather
 * than the Playwright-compatible object form: the fixture type is inferred
 * from what the function returns, so there is no second copy of it to keep
 * in step. `onCleanup` may be called **once** per fixture — a fixture that
 * needs two teardowns is two fixtures.
 *
 * Only app-wide screens live here. A harness specific to one spec (the stub
 * router in `components/appShell.spec.ts`, the tall sheet in
 * `dialogContent.spec.ts`) is a fixture in that spec, extending this one.

  /**
   * Runs a composable inside a component instance — the harness for everything
   * a composable only does when it has one: lifecycle hooks, `inject`, and the

   * [docs/testing-composables.md](../../docs/testing-composables.md) for which
   * composables need it, and `helpers/withSetup.ts` for what it mounts.
   *
   * It hands back the harness rather than the bare result, because a spec
   * about teardown has to be able to say when:
   *
   * ```ts
   * const { result: age, unmount } = mountComposable(() => useNoteAge(at))
   * ```
   *
   * Calling `unmount` is optional and idempotent — the fixture unmounts
   * whatever is still standing when the test ends, so the usual rule holds:
   * the spec never has to clean up, and can when that *is* the test.
   *
   * `onCleanup` may be called once per fixture, so the unmounts are collected
   * rather than registered one by one. Innermost first, mirroring the order a
   * component tree tears down in.
   *
   * Deliberately does **not** reset the app state, unlike the screen fixtures:
   * mounting one composable is not mounting the app, and a spec whose
   * composable reads the shared preferences says so with
   * `beforeEach(resetAppState)`, which is the convention
   * [testing-strategy.md](../../docs/testing-strategy.md) already sets for a
   * test that needs the reset without a screen. Keeping it out also keeps this
   * fixture free of the database, so it composes with fake timers.
