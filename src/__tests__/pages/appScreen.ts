/**
 * Screen objects: the browser tiers' page-object DSL.
 *
 * A spec says what the user did (`addNote`, `deleteNote`, `expectNote`); the
 * screen object holds the only copy of *how* — which role, which accessible
 * name, which lazy-loaded part has to be on screen first. Renaming a label
 * or reshaping a component is then one edit here rather than a grep across
 * four tiers, and a spec reads as the journey it is proving.
 *
 * Two rules keep them from turning into a second app:
 *
 * - **Locators are still roles and accessible names.** The DSL names the
 *   query, it does not replace it with a test id — a screen object that
 *   reaches for `[data-testid]` has stopped testing what a user can find.
 * - **They stop at the UI.** Assertions about IndexedDB stay in the spec:
 *   that a note survived to disk is the point of the test, not a detail of
 *   the page. `notesFlow.spec.ts` is the worked example.
 *
 * One class per screen, mirroring `src/views/`; nested parts (the quick-add
 * sheet) get their own object, mirroring the component that renders them.
 * `AppScreen` holds what every screen shares. Subclasses own the mounting —
 * `NotesScreen.open()` is the entry point, `close()` the teardown. Specs get
 * both through the fixtures in `src/__tests__/fixtures.ts` rather than
 * calling them by hand.
 *
 * Every `expect*` method is a field wrapped in `vi.defineHelper`, not a plain
 * method: the wrapper strips this file's frames from the stack, so a failure
 * reports at the line in the spec that asked for it rather than somewhere in
 * here.
 *
 * It is applied uniformly, but it is not uniformly load-bearing. A locator
 * assertion (`expect.element`) is already attributed to its call site by the
 * browser runner, so wrapping one changes nothing today. A plain `expect` or
 * an `expect.poll` is not — `NotesScreen.expectOrder` polls, and without the
 * wrapper its failures point in here. The rule is uniform so that adding an
 * assertion never requires knowing which of the two kinds you just wrote.
