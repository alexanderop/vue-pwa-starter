/**
 * Page objects: the e2e tier's DSL, and the counterpart of the screen
 * objects in `src/__tests__/pages/` — same vocabulary (`open`, `addNote`,
 * `expectNote`), different driver. A Gherkin step is then one line that
 * names the intent, and the locator behind it exists once.
 *
 * Steps stay declarative on purpose: a step that spells out its own
 * `getByRole(...)` is a step you have to read to know what it proves, and
 * `notes.feature` is meant to be readable by someone who never opens it.
 *
 * `AppPage` holds what is true of the shipped app on any route — the shell,
 * the document, the service worker, the network. Per-screen objects extend
 * it; `NotesPage` is the worked example.
